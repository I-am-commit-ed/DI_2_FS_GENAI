Brief justification:
- correctness: The SQL code perfectly addresses all parts of the exercise. It creates the database and table, inserts data as specified, and accurately performs all the required SELECT queries, filtering and ordering the data as instructed. All steps are followed accurately and completely.
- readability: The code is very readable, with clear comments explaining each step and query. The formatting is consistent and logical, making it easy to understand the purpose of each section.
- performance: The code uses efficient SQL practices, such as multi-row inserts and appropriate use of indexes (implicitly on the primary key). The queries are well-structured for efficient data retrieval.
- security: The code avoids any apparent security vulnerabilities. It uses parameterized queries (implicitly by using TO_DATE for date conversions) which prevents SQL injection.
