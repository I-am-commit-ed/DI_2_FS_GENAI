Exercise 1: Quiz (OOP concepts)
What is a class?

A class is a blueprint/type that defines data (attributes) and behavior (methods) for a kind of object.
Example: Card defines what a card has (suit, value) and what it can do (maybe __str__).

What is an instance?

An instance is a concrete object created from a class.
Example: Card("Hearts", "A") is an instance of Card.

What is encapsulation?

Encapsulation is bundling data + methods together and controlling access to internal state.
In Python, this is often done by:

keeping attributes “internal” by convention (_cards)

exposing safe methods (deal(), shuffle()) instead of letting outside code mess with internals directly.

What is abstraction?

Abstraction is exposing only what’s necessary and hiding implementation details.
Example: users call deck.deal() without needing to know whether the deck is stored as a list, how cards are removed, etc.

What is inheritance?

Inheritance lets a class (child/subclass) reuse/extend behavior from another class (parent/base class).
Example: class Student(Person).

What is multiple inheritance?

Multiple inheritance means a class inherits from more than one base class.
Example: class FlyingCar(Car, Airplane).

What is polymorphism?

Polymorphism means “many forms”: different classes can share the same interface/method name but behave differently.
Example: both Dog and Cat implement speak(), but each returns a different sound. Code can call animal.speak() without caring which animal it is.

What is method resolution order (MRO)?

MRO is the order Python uses to decide which parent class method to call when multiple inheritance is involved.
Python computes MRO using the C3 linearization algorithm, and you can inspect it with:

ClassName.mro()
