suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding docstrings to the TextModification methods to improve readability.
- The demo section is helpful for understanding the functionality but could be placed in a separate test file for better organization.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately implements all the required functionalities, including the `Text` class with `word_frequency`, `most_common_word`, `unique_words`, and `from_file` methods, as well as the `TextModification` class with `remove_punctuation`, `remove_stop_words`, and `remove_special_characters` methods. All instructions are followed precisely.
- readability: The code is well-structured and easy to follow. The use of type hints and dataclasses enhances readability. However, adding docstrings to the `TextModification` methods would further improve understanding.
- performance: The code uses efficient methods like `Counter` for finding the most common word and sets for finding unique words. Regular expressions are used appropriately for text cleaning. Overall, the performance is good.
- security: The code does not have any apparent security vulnerabilities. File handling includes basic error handling to prevent issues like `FileNotFoundError`. The use of `re.sub` is done safely.
