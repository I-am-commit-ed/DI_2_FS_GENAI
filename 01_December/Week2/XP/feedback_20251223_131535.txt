suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding comments to enhance code clarity, especially within the `check_win` function.
- The code could be restructured into classes for better organization, though the functional approach is perfectly acceptable.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately implements the Tic Tac Toe game as described in the Chapter Content/Questions. It includes the four required functions (`display_board`, `player_input`, `check_win`, and `play`) and correctly handles game logic, including player turns, win conditions, and tie games.
- readability: The code is generally well-structured and easy to follow. The function names are descriptive, and the code is adequately commented. Using more comments in the `check_win` function would improve readability.
- performance: The code's performance is adequate for this application. It avoids unnecessary computations and uses efficient data structures. There are no obvious performance bottlenecks.
- security: The code does not interact with external resources or handle sensitive data, so there are no apparent security concerns.
