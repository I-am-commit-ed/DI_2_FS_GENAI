Brief justification:
- correctness: The code perfectly addresses both challenges as described in the chapter content. Challenge 1 correctly calculates and outputs a list of multiples, while Challenge 2 accurately removes consecutive duplicate letters from a given string. Both challenges utilize the specified Python topics effectively.
- readability: The code is well-formatted and easy to understand. Comments are used to clearly indicate the start of each challenge and list the relevant Python topics.
- performance: The code uses efficient algorithms for both challenges, with linear time complexity in both cases, making it performant.
- security: The code uses the `int()` function to parse the user's input, which can prevent basic injection attacks. It handles string manipulation safely.
