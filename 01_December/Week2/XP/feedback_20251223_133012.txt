suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding comments to explain more complex logic, although the code is already quite clear.
- The use of f-strings is excellent for readability and maintainability.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code correctly implements all exercises as described in the prompt, including the bonus requirements for Exercise 5 and Exercise 7. Each function performs the expected task, and the outputs match the expected outputs provided in the prompt.
- readability: The code is well-structured and easy to read, with clear function definitions and descriptive variable names. Using f-strings enhances readability. The code is also separated into sections, each answering the exercises.
- performance: The code exhibits excellent performance. The functions are straightforward and efficient, with no unnecessary overhead or computationally expensive operations.
- security: There are no apparent security concerns with this code. It does not handle user input in a way that could lead to vulnerabilities, and it does not interact with any external resources or systems.
