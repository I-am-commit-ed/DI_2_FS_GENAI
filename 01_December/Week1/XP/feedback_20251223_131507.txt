Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately and completely solves all the problems described in the exercises. Each exercise is addressed with a correct solution, demonstrating understanding of print statements, variables, mathematical operations, comparison operators, if statements, and user input, as outlined in the chapter content.
- readability: The code is well-organized with clear comments separating each exercise. Variable names are descriptive, and the overall structure is easy to follow.
- performance: The code is efficient and performs the tasks without unnecessary complexity.
- security: The code uses `input()` function safely by converting the input to integers where needed, which mitigates potential security issues.
