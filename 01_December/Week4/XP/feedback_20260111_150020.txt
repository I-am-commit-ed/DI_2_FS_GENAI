suggestions for improvement:
- The AnagramChecker class instantiation is done in main but should be created outside the while loop to load the file only once during the program runtime.
- Consider adding error handling to manage unexpected issues during the anagram checking process.
- The code does not handle the case where the sowpods.txt is zipped. Consider extracting the data.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding a docstring to the `main` function to briefly describe its purpose.
- The use of type hints throughout the code enhances readability and helps prevent errors.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider using `collections.Counter` for more efficient anagram checking, especially for longer words. This could improve the `is_anagram` method.
- The code could benefit from more comprehensive error handling, such as handling potential exceptions when reading the word list file.
