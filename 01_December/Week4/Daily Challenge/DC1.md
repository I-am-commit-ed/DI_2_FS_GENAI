What is an instance?
An instance is a concrete object created from a class. It has its own attribute values and can call the class’s methods.

What is encapsulation?
Encapsulation is bundling data and the methods that operate on that data inside a class, and controlling access to the internal state (e.g., via properties), so code interacts through a clean interface.

What is abstraction?
Abstraction is exposing only the essential features of an object and hiding implementation details, so users can work with a simple, high-level API.

What is inheritance?
Inheritance is when a class (child/subclass) derives from another class (parent/superclass), reusing and extending its behavior and attributes.

What is multiple inheritance?
Multiple inheritance is when a class inherits from more than one parent class (e.g., class C(A, B): ...), combining behaviors from multiple bases.

What is polymorphism?
Polymorphism means “many forms”: different classes can be used through the same interface. For example, two different classes can implement the same method name (e.g., speak()), and code can call obj.speak() without caring about the exact class.

What is method resolution order (MRO)?
MRO is the order Python follows to search for methods/attributes in a class hierarchy (especially important in multiple inheritance). Python uses the C3 linearization algorithm; you can inspect it with ClassName.mro().
